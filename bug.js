This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue arises from the way React Native handles rendering and updating list items. When the list is long, and there are frequent updates (e.g., data changes, scrolling), it can lead to performance issues and even crashes.  Specifically, if the `keyExtractor` function is not correctly implemented, or if the component's `renderItem` function is computationally expensive, the list can become unresponsive or show incorrect data.

```javascript
// buggy component
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  keyExtractor={(item, index) => index} //Incorrect keyExtractor
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <Text>{item.longTextProperty}</Text> //Expensive renderItem 
  )}
/>
```
