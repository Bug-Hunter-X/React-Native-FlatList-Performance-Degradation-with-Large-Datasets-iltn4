The solution involves two key changes:

1. **Implement a proper `keyExtractor`:** Instead of using the index, use a unique identifier from your data (e.g., an ID field). This allows React Native to efficiently update the list items.
2. **Optimize `renderItem`:** If possible, simplify the rendering logic inside `renderItem` to minimize expensive operations. You may need to use techniques like memoization or virtualization for very large datasets.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
<FlatList
  data={largeDataset}
  keyExtractor={item => item.id} //Correct keyExtractor
  renderItem={({ item }) => (
    <Text>{item.shortTextProperty}</Text> // Optimized renderItem
  )}
/>
```

This revised code significantly improves the `FlatList` performance, eliminating the slow rendering and potential crashes.  Always ensure you use unique keys and minimize computations within `renderItem` for optimal performance with large datasets in React Native.
